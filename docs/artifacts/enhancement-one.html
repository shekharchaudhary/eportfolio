        <h2>Milestone Two: Enhancement One – Software Design & Engineering</h2>

        <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
        <p>
          For my first enhancement under software design and engineering, I chose the Inventory App I built
          during CS-360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming). This app was originally created in Java using
          Android Studio, with SQLite as the database, and tested through the Nexus emulator. Its main purpose
          is to let users track inventory items directly from an Android device.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I picked this artifact is because it shows the full software design and engineering
          process — from planning and UI/UX considerations to coding standards, security practices, and
          database integration.
        </p>

        <h3>Why This Artifact Fits Software Design & Engineering</h3>
        <p>This project highlights the entire workflow of creating software:</p>
        <ul style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem;">
          <li>Designing layouts and screens that focus on user-friendly, intuitive interactions.</li>
          <li>Following industry standards for icons and interface elements.</li>
          <li>Building with security in mind, including input validation and a "default deny" approach.</li>
          <li>Using data structures and relational databases to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In short, it wasn't just about writing code. It was about thinking through the end-to-end experience:
          what users need, how they interact with the app, and how the back end supports it.
        </p>

        <h3>Enhancements I Made</h3>
        <p>The major enhancements I added focused on making the app fully functional and more aligned with best practices:</p>
        <ul style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem;">
          <li>Implemented complete CRUD functionality for items.</li>
          <li>Improved SQLHelper class to make database operations cleaner and more efficient.</li>
          <li>Applied user-centered design principles, ensuring the app feels natural and smooth to use.</li>
          <li>Strengthened security features, including user authentication (name, phone, email), password recovery,
              and a zero-trust mindset throughout.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These changes show my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that not only solve a problem
          but also balance trade-offs in performance, usability, and security.
        </p>

        <h3>Coding Practices</h3>
        <p>While coding, I followed Java best practices to keep things readable and maintainable:</p>
        <ul style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem;">
          <li>Consistent naming conventions (camelCase, CapWords, etc.).</li>
          <li>Proper formatting and indentation.</li>
          <li>In-line comments to explain the purpose of methods and classes.</li>
          <li>Clear separation of concerns across files (e.g., layout files lowercase, Java class files in CapWords).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This not only improved the readability of my own code but also made it easier for others to review,
          debug, or extend the app.
        </p>
