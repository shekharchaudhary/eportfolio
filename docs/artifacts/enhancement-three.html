        <h2>Milestone Four: Enhancement Three – Databases</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The database enhancement I implemented for this milestone originated from my CS-340 (Client/Server
          Development) project and was further aligned with the data design concepts explored in CS-300 (Data
          Structures). The original artifact involved developing a MongoDB-driven application for managing and
          retrieving animal shelter data using a web dashboard interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this enhancement, I focused on normalizing the schema, adding stored procedures for core database
          operations, and introducing role-based access control (RBAC) to strengthen both the usability and
          security of the system.
        </p>

        <h3>Enhancement Goals</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of this enhancement was to improve the scalability, security, and maintainability of the
          database component by ensuring that the schema adhered to third normal form (3NF) and that user
          operations were governed by defined roles (e.g., admin, staff, viewer). These improvements directly
          contribute to the Computer Science program outcomes related to secure database design, query
          optimization, and adversarial-aware software architecture.
        </p>

        <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
        <p>
          The database originally consisted of a single "Users" and "Animals" collection managed through MongoDB.
          While functional, it lacked normalized relationships and centralized security enforcement.
        </p>

        <h4>For this milestone, I enhanced the artifact by:</h4>
        <ul style="color: var(--muted); line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem;">
          <li>
            <strong>Normalizing Tables:</strong> Breaking down unstructured collections into smaller relational
            entities (Users, Roles, Permissions, and Animals). This eliminates redundancy and ensures data consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Implementing Stored Procedures:</strong> Creating procedures for repeated operations such as
            adding users and inserting animal records while validating input roles and permissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Integrating Role-Based Access Control:</strong> Restricting actions to specific roles — for
            example, only administrators can add new users, and only registered users can add or modify animals.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stored Procedure Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          One of the major enhancements was implementing a stored procedure for secure user creation. This
          procedure ensures only predefined roles are accepted, preventing unauthorized privilege escalation.
          Furthermore, each user's password is hashed using the PBKDF2 algorithm (pbkdf2_sha256) before storage,
          ensuring that sensitive credentials are never stored in plain text.
        </p>

        <div style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.3); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 12px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-primary);">
          <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--text-bright);">Secure User Creation Pseudocode</h4>
          <pre style="margin: 0; overflow-x: auto;"><code>PROCEDURE AddUser(username, password, role)
  IF role NOT IN ('admin', 'staff', 'viewer') THEN
    RAISE ERROR 'Invalid role specified'
  END IF

  hashed_password = PBKDF2_SHA256(password)

  INSERT INTO Users (username, hashed_password, role, created_at)
  VALUES (username, hashed_password, role, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

  RETURN success_message
END PROCEDURE</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Security Enhancements</h3>
        <p>
          Another enhancement involved modularizing authentication into separate files (<code>Authentication.py</code>)
          to improve code readability and maintain separation of concerns between the application logic and
          authentication logic.
        </p>

        <div class="grid two">
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Password Security</h4>
            <p>
              Implemented PBKDF2-SHA256 hashing algorithm for password storage, ensuring credentials are never
              stored in plain text and protecting against rainbow table attacks.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Role-Based Access Control</h4>
            <p>
              Defined three user roles (admin, staff, viewer) with specific permissions, enforcing the principle
              of least privilege throughout the application.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Input Validation</h4>
            <p>

              ensuring data integrity at the database layer.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Schema Normalization</h4>
            <p>
              Achieved 3NF by separating Users, Roles, Permissions, and Animals into distinct tables, eliminating
              redundancy and improving data consistency.
            </p>
          </section>
        </div>

        <h3>MongoDB Operations</h3>
        <p>Key database operations performed during development and testing:</p>
        <div style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
          <code style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--accent-tertiary);">
# Navigate to dataset directory
cd /usr/local/datasets

# MongoDB Shell Commands
