        <h2>Milestone Three: Enhancement Two – Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>

        <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The artifact I selected for Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures is my sorting and searching
          program from CS-300. This program was originally created to demonstrate fundamental algorithmic
          principles, including linear search, binary search, and basic sorting methods. While the original
          version applied these concepts successfully, it did not fully explore efficiency and scalability
          when working with larger datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose this artifact for enhancement because it provides a strong foundation for demonstrating
          algorithm design, performance trade-offs, and optimization—skills essential for developing scalable
          systems and preparing for real-world software engineering and AI-related roles.
        </p>

        <h3>High-Impact Enhancements Implemented</h3>

        <h4>1. Advanced Searching Structures (HashMap and Binary Search)</h4>
        <p>
          After loading bids, I built a hash map index for O(1) average-case lookup by bidId and maintained
          a sorted vector to enable O(log n) binary search by title. This enhancement allows me to compare
          constant-time lookups against logarithmic searches, reinforcing the importance of selecting
          appropriate data structures for specific use cases.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Third Sorting Algorithm with Stability Discussion (MergeSort)</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to Selection Sort and QuickSort, I implemented MergeSort, which provides stability at
          the cost of additional memory. By comparing QuickSort's speed, MergeSort's stability, and Selection
          Sort's inefficiency, I highlighted trade-offs in time complexity, space usage, and output reliability.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Reproducible Benchmarking with Modern Timing Tools</h4>
        <p>
          To provide measurable evidence, I replaced <code>clock()</code> with <code>std::chrono::steady_clock</code>
          and exported results to a CSV file for analysis. This change ensures accuracy, reproducibility, and
          professional-level reporting of runtime performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Performance Results</h3>
        <p>Preliminary benchmarks using the 17,937-row dataset showed:</p>
        <div class="grid three">
          <section class="card">
            <h4>QuickSort</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--accent-primary); font-weight: 700; margin: 0.5rem 0;">~42ms</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">Fastest but unstable</p>
          </section>
          <section class="card">
            <h4>MergeSort</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--accent-secondary); font-weight: 700; margin: 0.5rem 0;">~57ms</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">Stable, uses more memory</p>
          </section>
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Selection Sort</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 2rem; color: var(--muted); font-weight: 700; margin: 0.5rem 0;">>12,000ms</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">Baseline for comparison</p>
          </section>
        </div>
        <p>
          These results directly connect theoretical Big-O analysis to real-world outcomes, demonstrating
          measurable performance improvements and algorithmic efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>
          Effective enhancement is not about adding complexity for its own sake but about making thoughtful,
          purposeful design choices. Implementing the hash map required balancing collision handling and memory
          reallocation strategies, while building the binary search index emphasized the importance of sorted data.
        </p>
        <p>
          MergeSort added an opportunity to discuss algorithm stability, which is often overlooked in entry-level
          programs. One challenge was ensuring benchmark results remained consistent and interpretable, which I
          resolved by running multiple trials and exporting results for visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this work, I deepened my understanding of theoretical algorithm analysis, practical performance
          testing, and the communication of results in ways meaningful to both technical and professional audiences.
        </p>

        <h3>Course Outcomes Addressed</h3>
        <div class="grid two">
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Algorithmic Design & Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              Demonstrated ability to design, implement, and evaluate multiple sorting and searching algorithms
              with comprehensive Big-O complexity analysis and empirical benchmarking.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Data Structure Selection</h4>
            <p>
              Applied appropriate data structures (hash maps, sorted vectors) to optimize performance for
              specific use cases, achieving O(1) and O(log n) search times.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Performance Optimization</h4>
            <p>
              Identified performance bottlenecks and implemented optimizations that resulted in measurable
              improvements (QuickSort 285x faster than Selection Sort).
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="card">
            <h4>Trade-off Management</h4>
            <p>
              Analyzed and communicated trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and algorithm
              stability to make informed engineering decisions.
            </p>
          </section>
        </div>

        <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
        <p><strong>File Enhanced:</strong> <code>VectorSorting.cpp</code></p>
        <p>
          The enhancement transformed this program from a basic sorting demonstration into a comprehensive
          algorithms and data structures showcase. Instead of only running Selection Sort and QuickSort on bids,
          I now demonstrate how multiple sorting algorithms (Selection, Quick, Merge) compare in terms of
          stability, memory use, and runtime performance.
