        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of my Computer Science program, my career plans have shifted and matured in
          meaningful ways. Initially, I entered the program with the broad goal of becoming a software
          engineer, primarily focused on web and mobile development. However, as I progressed through
          the curriculum, especially in advanced courses like databases, algorithms, and system design,
          my interests evolved toward building scalable, intelligent systems that leverage AI and
          data-driven decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shift was prompted by my exposure to emerging fields like retrieval-augmented generation
          (RAG) and multi-agent AI systems, which align closely with my long-term vision of becoming an
          AI engineer and building products that can impact millions of users. My thinking has evolved
          from pursuing a single-track development role to envisioning myself as a technical leader who
          can architect solutions that merge software engineering principles with machine learning innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To support this career trajectory, I have researched both the job market and academic pathways
          for AI-focused engineers. I found that companies at the forefront of AI innovation highly value
          a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software design, coupled with specialized
          certifications in AI and cloud platforms. As a result, I am considering pursuing certifications
          in cloud engineering (AWS, GCP) and advanced training in machine learning frameworks after
          graduation. These steps will strengthen my ability to contribute immediately to industry while
          keeping open the possibility of a master's degree in AI or data science in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of course outcomes, I have achieved significant progress in designing scalable systems,
          optimizing algorithms, and structuring relational databases. This ePortfolio represents the
          culmination of my learning journey, showcasing not just technical achievement but also clear
          demonstrations of problem-solving impact through performance improvements, usability enhancements,
          and scalable architectural decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          Completing my coursework in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University
          and developing this ePortfolio has been a transformative journey that has significantly shaped
          my professional capabilities, goals, and values. Through rigorous study and hands-on project
          work, I have cultivated a comprehensive skill set that spans software engineering, algorithms
          and data structures, database design, and secure coding practices—all essential competencies
          for succeeding in today's technology-driven landscape.
        </p>

        <h3>Collaboration and Team Environments</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the program, I learned the importance of building collaborative environments that
          enable diverse audiences to support decision-making. In courses like CS-250 (Software Development
          Lifecycle) and CS-320 (Software Testing and QA), I worked extensively with version control
          systems, pull requests, and code reviews—practices that are fundamental to team-based software
          development. These experiences taught me to write clear, contextual in-code comments and
          documentation that make my work accessible to team members with varying technical backgrounds.
          The code review component of this capstone further demonstrates my ability to articulate technical
          decisions and facilitate constructive dialogue about software architecture and design choices.
        </p>

        <h3>Communication with Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>
          Effective communication is central to software development success. I have honed my ability to
          design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications that are coherent, technically
          sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences. Whether creating detailed README files,
          architecture diagrams, API documentation, or narrative reflections for this ePortfolio, I have
          learned to tailor my message to diverse stakeholders—from technical team members to non-technical
          decision-makers. This ePortfolio itself exemplifies my commitment to clear visual and written
          communication, presenting complex technical achievements in an organized, accessible format that
          demonstrates both my technical expertise and professional presentation skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
          My work in CS-260 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CS-300 laid the foundation for designing
          and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science best practices.
          I have developed proficiency in selecting appropriate data structures for specific problems,
          analyzing algorithmic complexity using Big-O notation, and making informed trade-offs between
          time and space efficiency. The Algorithm and Data Structure enhancement in this portfolio showcases
          my ability to identify performance bottlenecks, implement optimized solutions, and provide
          empirical benchmarks demonstrating measurable improvements. This work reflects my commitment to
          writing efficient, scalable code that delivers real-world value.
        </p>

        <h3>Software Engineering and Databases</h3>
        <p>
          Software engineering excellence requires both solid architectural design and effective data
          management. Through coursework in IT-315 (Object-Oriented Analysis and Design), CS-340 (Advanced
          Programming Concepts), and DAD-220 (Introduction to SQL), I gained experience in applying design
          patterns, implementing SOLID principles, and creating normalized database schemas. My Software
          Design and Engineering enhancement demonstrates my ability to refactor code for improved modularity,
          maintainability, and testability, while my Database enhancement showcases skills in query
          optimization, indexing strategies, transaction management, and data security. These enhancements
          reflect industry-standard practices and my ability to deliver robust, production-quality solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          In an era of increasing cyber threats, developing a security mindset is essential. Courses like
          CS-405 (Secure Coding) taught me to anticipate adversarial exploits, identify vulnerabilities,
          and implement defensive measures throughout the software development lifecycle. Across all three
          enhancements in this portfolio, I have demonstrated security-conscious practices: input validation,
          parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, least-privilege access controls, secure error
          handling that doesn't expose sensitive information, and threat modeling during the design phase.
          This proactive approach to security ensures that privacy and data protection are built into my
          solutions from the ground up, not added as an afterthought.
        </p>

        <h3>Portfolio Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This ePortfolio integrates my learning across the Computer Science program through three carefully
          selected and enhanced artifacts, each demonstrating mastery in a core competency area: Software
          Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Together, these artifacts
          showcase my ability to write clean, efficient, secure, and maintainable code; to apply computer
          science theory to practical problems; and to communicate technical concepts effectively to diverse
          audiences. The enhancements represent not just technical improvements, but evidence of my growth
          as a professional software developer prepared to deliver value in industry settings.
        </p>
